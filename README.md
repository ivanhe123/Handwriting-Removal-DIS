# Handwriting-Removal-DIS
My effort into improving handwriting removal throught the new DIS (Dichotomous Image Segmentation)

## Related Research
AndSonder has also done research and experimentaion on the same subject but using deeplabv3+ to segment the handwriting.
This is a link to his repo: [https://github.com/AndSonder/HandWritingEraser-Pytorch](https://github.com/AndSonder/HandWritingEraser-Pytorch)
HUGE THANKS to them for providing the segmentation datasets labeled with background blue, printed characters green, and handwriting in red.
